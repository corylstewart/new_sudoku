Welcome to my demo site.  The old sight is still up and running and are located <a href=http://coryoptionpage.appspot.com>here</a>.
Those pages were built before I started to try to learn JavaScript.  While they were good practice on building more of the back
end, they only served up static web-pages.  So here are my attempts to bring the pages a little more life.

<h1>Option Model</h1>
<ol>
    <li><h3>Purpose</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Build a web-app that can be used to accurately model an equity option position and all of its greeks.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><h3>Goals</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a streaming web-app that uses a range of cached values to create a real time option position.</li>
        <li>Use a database to store users positions.</li>
        <li>Provide analytics to show how a position/book would perform in different market conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><h3>Features so far</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Database containing all of a users positions.  If the user is not logged in they will have access to the guest account.</li>
        <li>Although I would like to use real time/delayed market data I feel that it would be a violation of user agreements.
            So I give the user the most current stock price.  From there the user can change the price by hand or use a very
            simple random stock move generator to see the positions move in "real time".
        </li>
        <li>The model that I am using is a very simple Black Scholes implementation.  This has many drawbacks the most important
            of which is that you cannot model dividend paying stocks accurately.  Until I come up with a JavaScript model for
            something better that is going to be a huge limitation.
        </li>
    </ul>  
    <li><h3>Future improvements</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I would like to show P&L graphs for single stocks in a variety of market scenarios.
        </li>
        <li>
            Also, I would like to add an overall book view providing the user all of the greeks from all of the positions in real time.
        </li>
        <li>
            In addition to a book view, I would like to add P&L graphs for the overall book in different market conditions.
        </li>
        <li>I have had to limit the size of the tree substantially both to limit instance use and reduce the timeouts.</li>
        <li>Streaming does not seem like a reasonable option due to the limitations of the system at this time.</li>
        <li>Add a page for viewing and setting skew versus the implied volatility</li>
        <li>Find a library or come up with my own implementation of an option pricing model.  At this time that is well out of
            the scope of my own ideas of what this project is about as well as above my mathematics background.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<h1>Sudoku</h1>
<ol>
    <li><h3>Purpose</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a program that can create and solve valid puzzles of varying degrees of difficulty.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><h3>Goals</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Create algorithms that can solve increasingly harder puzzles and never have to use brute force to solve
            a valid grid that does not require guessing to solve the problem.
        </li>
        <li>Create an algorithm that can create valid Sudoku grids of different difficulties.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><h3>Features</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Ability to solve user generated grids and add them to database of grids.</li>
        <li>Multiple levels of difficulty based on what techniques are required to solve the puzzle.  Using rules 
            such as simple number elimination, pair and triplets, hidden pairs and triplets
        </li>
        
    </ul>
    <li><h3>Limitations</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Although while using brute force in addition to my algorithms the program will find a solution.  It 
            won't notice if a grid has more than one solution.
        </li>
        <li>I would like to add a few more layers of algorithms so that brute force is less used.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <li><h3>Future Improvements</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Track what puzzles the user has tried and record the times they finished the puzzle in.</li>
        <li>My old version can generate grids, but I have not implemented that in this version yet.</li>
        <li>Figure out a better way to generate more difficult grids.</li>
       
    </ul>   
</ol>

<h1>Art Collection</h1>
<ol>
    <li><h3>Purpose</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a easy way for my father-in-law to track his art collection.</li>
        <li>This project is still a work in progress changes are being made daily.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><h3>Goals</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Have simple form for entering information about artwork.</li>
        <li>Have a simple way to view the collection using different queries.</li>
        <li>Be able to create reports for export to Excell or MS Access.</li>
        <li>Send emails to my brother-in-law so that he can track progress.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><h3>Features</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>I have built the database and the forms for entering information.</li>
        <li>
            Viewing gallery is now searchable by location and medium.  Sorting is
            available on a number of indexes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Personal galleries are only viewable while logged in.  When logged in
            as a guest you see the guest gallery.
        </li>
        <li>
            Art work information is now editable.  From the viewing gallery
            click on an image to get to the edit page.
        </li>
        <li>Able to resize images so that the file size fits within a BlobProperty.</li>
        <li>Seems like I am catching the errors if no file is selected.</li>
        <li>
            I have set up an email notification system.  I receive alerts when a user
            sets up an account, and adds photos.  I will set it up so that my
            brother-in-law will gets reports when my father-in-law adds a new piece to
            his collection.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reports can be generated and uploaded to a Google Drive account. The photos
            are stored as individual documents, and there is a master spreadsheet
            containing all of the information about the art.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li><h3>Future Improvements</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Figure out what fields are necessary and which are not.</li>
        <li>
            Need to fix the spreadsheet generator so that it does a batch change
            rather then inserting each row.
        </li>
        <li>Would like to set up a task queue for generating the reports.</li>
        <li>Would like the viewing gallery to look a little nicer.  Playing
            with the layout would be nice.  But want to nail down the fields
            before I attempt that.
        </li>
        <li>
            Would be nice to set up the gallery view so that I only
            hit the DB once, and handle all of the sorting and filtering
            with javascript.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<h1>Other Projects and Goals</h1>
<ol>
    <li><h3>Helpful Reminders</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a website that users can set up reminders of chores that are maintenance related.</li>
        <li>Users could input a variety of items that they need reminders for.  And the site would e-mail
            reminders for the user to do them.
        </li>
        <li>Examples of the task are to change the oil in their car, the filter in the furnace, or call
            someone on their birthday.</li>
        <li>Once the reminder is set the user can log in and set the task to done once it is finished.</li>
        <li>A possible way to monetize it would be to offer coupons and advertising with the reminders
            for what ever the task is.
        </li>
        <li>A pie in the sky idea would be to have the user put in actual model numbers on items, such as
            car, appliances.  Using those model numbers come up with actual maintenance scheduling based on
            user manuals.
        </li>
        </ul>
    <li><h3>CSS and JavaScript</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Practice, practice, practice.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
